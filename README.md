Ramcash-history-viewer
======================

This may be of limited use outside of our specific openbravopos version, but it's a very pretty history viewer and it makes a lot of bookkeeping stuff a lot more convenient. It also relies on some specific configurations relating to taxes. Specifically useful in Canadian provinces that have separate PST and GST.

It'll show you a list of sales for a given day, with receipt numbers, each receipt broken down by patment if there are multiple payments, as well as per-day tax stuff.

Installation
------------

Copy `config.example.php` to `config.php` and edit for your mysql configuration. That's it!
